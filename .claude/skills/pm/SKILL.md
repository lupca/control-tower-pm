description: Hand off a new task or break down an ambiguous request into a task with verifiable Acceptance Criteria, using code-review-graph (read-only) to find blast radius/tests/risk, compute pre-execution prediction score (predicted_success), walk it through Spec Gate + Plan Gate, then dispatch it to an executor outside the system. Never writes code itself, never self-verifies — review happens entirely outside control-tower (see /review-order, /verdict). Activate when the user types /pm or talks about handing off/managing/planning a task for a specific project.

## Project Manager — PLAN + COORDINATE, never EXECUTE

The user invokes: `/pm $ARGUMENTS`. You're running inside the `control-tower` repo, NOT the target repo — every graph tool call must include an absolute `repo_root`. **Model B: `/pm` only plans and coordinates. It NEVER writes code itself, never spawns an executing subagent, never runs tests, never closes a task.** EXECUTE and REVIEW both happen outside the system (see `AGENTS.md` §1, §4).

### Step 0 — Locate the project

1. Read `AGENTS.md` (roles, DoD, gates, task syntax, graph rules) and `index.md` §2 (PROJECT REGISTRY) if not already read this session.
2. Determine the target project:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` includes `--project <name>`, use that exact name to look up the registry.
   - Otherwise, infer it from the description (e.g. "variant"/"PMI" → `topvnsport-pmi`; "order"/"OMS" → `topvnsport-oms`). If unsure, ask the User.
   - Get the absolute `repo_root` + `Task dir` (`projects/<name>/tasks/`) from the registry. Read `projects/<name>/<name>.md` (the file matching the folder name) to get `task_prefix` + `next_task_id`. If the project isn't in the registry yet, stop and tell the User it needs onboarding first (`AGENTS.md` §10).

### Step 1 — Determine which stage you're at

- **New request / no matching task file yet in `projects/<name>/tasks/*.md`** (Glob to check) → follow `.claude/skills/pm/references/task-creation.md` (Spec Gate, `status: todo`). Computes `predicted_success` and `prediction_factors` before creating task. Stop and wait for approval after writing the task.
- **Task already exists, Spec Gate was just approved by the User** (User says "ok", "approved", "I agree with this AC"...) → follow `references/task-execution.md` (Plan Gate → `ready` → `dispatched`). Matches task domain strengths with `knowledge/agents/*.md` profiles to suggest best-fit executor. Stop after recording `executor:` + `dispatched`.

**`/pm` has NO third step.** Once a task is `status: dispatched`, `/pm`'s job on that task is done. When the executor reports completion, the next step is `/review-order` (a separate skill, run independently — not an automatic continuation of `/pm`).

Never assume a gate has passed unless the User has explicitly confirmed it in words — silence or ambiguity does NOT count as approval.

### Common mistakes to avoid

- Forgetting `repo_root` → the graph tool auto-detects based on `control-tower`'s cwd and returns wrong/empty results.
- Calling `query_graph_tool` with an `edge` parameter — the real tool only has `pattern`/`target`, no `edge`.
- Using the default `top_n` (10) for `get_hub_nodes_tool`/`get_bridge_nodes_tool` — far too small for a large repo, so `⚠️high-risk` almost never triggers. Always pass `top_n=50`.
- Writing an absolute path into `files:` instead of a path relative to `repo_root`.
- Automatically skipping past a gate without explicit User confirmation.
- **Writing code yourself, running tests yourself, or closing a task yourself (`- [x]`).** This is no longer `/pm`'s job under Model B — no matter how simple a task looks, writing code always happens outside the system and closing a task always goes through `/verdict`.
