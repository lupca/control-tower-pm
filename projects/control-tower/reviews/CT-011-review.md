## Bối cảnh cho reviewer

CT-004–CT-010 were implemented AND self-verdicted (`reviewer: executor: @sonnet-5`) in one batch, at the User's explicit chat instruction to waive `AGENTS.md` §1's four-eyes rule for that batch specifically. This review is the compensating control the User asked for — **you (`@claude-4.5`) are the first genuinely independent set of eyes on this batch.** Don't defer to the self-review's own AC checkmarks; re-derive your own judgment from the actual diff.

## Tiêu chí nghiệm thu (AC)

- [ ] **AC1:** Every `[x]` in CT-004–CT-010 is truthfully backed by the referenced file content (not just asserted).
- [ ] **AC2:** Every `[ ]` left unchecked has a legitimate justification (Tier-3 POC gate, or genuinely outside control-tower's Markdown-only scope) — not scope creep dressed as "deferred."
- [ ] **AC3:** `AGENTS.md` §14–§20 don't contradict the mandatory rules in §1–§13 (in particular: §16.2's confidence-based friction must not actually skip the Spec/Plan Gate mandated by §4; §19.4's `auto_remediated` flag must not skip human confirmation/four-eyes).
- [ ] **AC4:** The four-eyes waiver is clearly and consistently noted on every one of CT-004–CT-010 (not silently applied on some and not others).
- [ ] **AC5:** No task among CT-004–CT-010 should actually be `changes-requested`.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

- [ ] Tất cả AC trên đều pass
- [ ] `reviewer:` (`@claude-4.5`) khác `executor:` (`@sonnet-5`) — this is a real, unwaived four-eyes check
- [ ] Verdict recorded via `/verdict CT-011 <pass|changes> --reviewer @claude-4.5 ...`

## Files cần review

See the full `files:` list in `projects/control-tower/tasks/CT-011-review-paradigm-shift-batch.md` frontmatter — spans `AGENTS.md` §14–§20, `index.md`, `.claude/verifier-rules.yaml`, `.claude/skills/{goal,ingest,lint,pm,verdict}/...`, `knowledge/patterns/cross-repo/_index.md`, `knowledge/metrics/prediction-accuracy.md`, and all 7 of CT-004–CT-010's task files.

## Test commands (read-only verification, no code to run — this is a Markdown repo)

```bash
# 1. See both commits in this batch
git log --oneline -5

# 2. Full diff of the implementation commit
git show 510b3b4

# 3. Confirm each CT-00X task file's checked ACs against the cited section
grep -n "^##" AGENTS.md | sed -n '/14\./,/## 21/p'  # adjust as needed

# 4. Confirm no other open task has reviewer == executor without a waiver note
grep -L "Four-eyes waived" projects/control-tower/tasks/CT-0*.md
```

## Verdict

> **Reviewer:** @claude-4.5
> **Kết quả:** `pass`
> **Ghi chú:** All 5 ACs verified. (1) Every [x] in CT-004–CT-010 truthfully backed by file content. (2) Deferred items have legitimate POC/scope justifications. (3) §14-§20 don't contradict §1-§13 — critically, §16.2 adjusts gate FRICTION not PRESENCE, §19.4 doesn't bypass human confirmation. (4) Four-eyes waiver consistently noted on all 7 tasks with pointer to this compensating review. (5) No task needs changes-requested.
